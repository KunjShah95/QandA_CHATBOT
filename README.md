This Python file, qa.py, demonstrates a simple question-and-answer (Q&A) application powered by Google's Gemini Pro language model. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Setup and Configuration:

Import Libraries: The code imports necessary libraries:
dotenv: To load environment variables from a .env file.
streamlit: For building the web application interface.
os: For interacting with the operating system (to access environment variables).
google.generativeai: To interact with Google's Generative AI API.
Load API Key: It loads the Google Cloud API key from the environment variable GOOGLE_API_KEY. This key is essential for authenticating with the Generative AI API.
Configure API: It configures the google.generativeai library using the loaded API key.
Initialize Gemini Pro Model: It creates an instance of the gemini-pro model from the google.generativeai library.


2. Chat Function:

get_gemini_response(question): This function takes a user's question as input and interacts with the Gemini Pro model to get a response.
It starts a chat session with the model using model.start_chat(history=[]).
It sends the question to the chat session using chat.send_message(question, stream=True).
It returns the response from the model, which is streamed in chunks.


3. Streamlit App:

Page Configuration: It sets the page title to "Q&A Demo" using st.set_page_config().
Header: It displays a header "Gemini LLM Application" using st.header().
Session State: It initializes a session state variable chat_history to store the conversation history.
User Input: It provides a text input field for the user to enter their question using st.text_input().
Submit Button: It includes a button labeled "Ask the question" using st.button().
Response Handling:
When the user submits a question:
It calls get_gemini_response() to get the model's response.
It displays the response to the user using st.write().
It updates the chat_history session state with both the user's question and the model's response.
Chat History: It displays the conversation history using st.subheader() and st.write().
In summary, this code creates a simple web application that allows users to ask questions to Google's Gemini Pro language model and view the responses in a conversational format.
